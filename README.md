# PDF to JSON Extractor

This project extracts text from PDF documents, processes them with AI models, and converts them into **structured JSON** using **Pydantic models**.

## Features

* Extract text from PDFs using **OCR (RapidAPI)**
* Use **OpenAI API** to classify and convert text into structured JSON
* Validate extracted data with **Pydantic schemas**

---

## 🔑 API Keys Setup

You need two API keys. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add:

```ini
# RapidAPI OCR Service (for text extraction from images/PDF)
RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key_here  
# API Reference: https://rapidapi.com/restyler/api/ocr-extract-text/

# OpenAI API (for LLM processing)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

### Run main script

```bash
python main.py
```

1. Extract text from the PDF.
2. Send it to OpenAI API for processing.
3. Validate against Pydantic models.
4. Output structured JSON.
